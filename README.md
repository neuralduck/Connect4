# Connect4  
A small learning project to explore pygame library and minimax algorithm for board games.  

  
1. install pygame
2. run `bot_cli.py` to play against the computer in the terminal  or run `game.py` for a 2 player GUI version of the game (useful for passing time at the office)
3. Have fun
